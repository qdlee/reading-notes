# 软件测试的艺术

## 软件测试的定义

Testing is the process of executing a program with the intent of finding errors.

软件测试是为了发现错误而执行程序的过程。

## 软件测试的10个原则

1. 一个测试用例必不可少的部分是定义期望的输出或者结果。
2. 程序员应该避免测试他自己的程序。
3. 编程组织应该避免测试它自己的程序。
4. 任何测试过程都应该包括对每个测试结果的彻底检查。
5. 必须为所有无效和不期望的输入，以及有效和期望的输入编写测试用例。
6. 检查程序是否没有做期望它做的事只是胜利了一半，另一半是看它是否做了不期望它做的事。
7. 避免废弃测试用例，除非程序真得被废弃了。
8. 不要在默认找不到错误的假定之下计划测试。
9. 在程序的某个部分存在错误的可能性与在该部分已经找到的错误数量成正比。
10. 软件测试是一个相当有创造性和智力挑战性的任务。

## 代码审查（code inspection）

一个审查团队由4名成员组成

###### 主持人

等同于质量控制工程师，需要是能力胜任的程序员，但不需要对程序特别熟悉。主持人的职责包括：

* 分发材料并安排审查会议
* 主持会议
* 记录所有找到的错误
* 确保错误后续被更正

###### 程序的作者

###### 程序的设计者

###### 测试专家

### 审查议程

1. 会议的前几天，主持人给其他成员分发程序列表和设计规范。成员熟悉材料。
2. 程序作者一句句地叙述程序的逻辑，其他成员应提出问题来确定是否存在错误。（看起来，只是简单地对一个听众大声地读出程序的行动就是一种非常有效的错误检测技术）
3. 根据历史常见错误检查列表来分析程序

### 注意事项

* 会议的目的是发现错误，不是修正错误。
* 会议不能被打断
* 会议的时间在90到120分钟之间

### 额外的好处

* 程序员通常可以获得关于编程风格，算法选择，和编程技术方面有价值的反馈。其他成员通过看到别人的错误和编辑风格也可以获得同样的好处。
* 可以帮助团队增强处理此类项目的能力，或者包含这些成员的项目的能力。
* 减少潜在的对抗的演化，有利于合作，团队工作，能够通向更加高效和可靠的软件开发。
* 能够在早期发现存在更多错误的部分。

## 错误检查清单

### 数据引用错误(Data Reference Errors)

* Does a referenced variable have a value that is unset or uninitialized.
* For all array references, is each subscript value within the bounds of then corresponding dimension.
* For all array references, does each subscript have an integer value.
* For all references through pointer or reference variables, is the referenced memory currently allocated.
* When a memory area has alias names with differing attributes,does the data vlue in this area has the correct attributes when referenced via one of these names.
* Does a variable's value have type or attribute other than what the compiler expects.
* Are there any explicit or implicit addressing problem if,on the computer being used,the units of memory allocation are smaller than the units of  addressable memory.
* If pointer or reference variables are used,does the referenced memory location have the attributes the compiler expects.
* If a data structure is referenced in multiple procedures or subroutines,is the structure defined identically in each procedure.
* When indexing into a string,are the limits of the string off by one in indexing operations or in subscript references to arrays. 
* For object-oriented languages, are all inheritance requirements met in the implementing class.

### 数据声明错误(Data Declaration Errors)

* Have all variables been explicitly declared.
* If all attributes of a variable are not explicitly stated in declaration, are the defaults well understood.
* Where a variable is initialized in a declarative statement,is it properly initialized.
* Is each variable assigned the correct length and data type.
* Is the initialization of a variable consistent with its memory type.
* Are there any variables with similar names(e.g., VOLT and VOLTS).

### 计算错误(Computation Errors)

* Are there any computations using variables having inconsistent(such as nonarithmetic) data types.
* Are there any mixed-mode computations.
* Are there any computations using variables having the same data type but of different lengths.
* Is the data type of the target variable of a assignment smaller than the data type or a result of right-hand expression.
* Is an overflow or underflow expression possible during the computation of an expression.
* Is it possible for the divisor in a division operation to be zero.
* If the underlying machine represents variables in base-2 form,are there any sequences of resulting inaccuracy
* Where applicable,can the value of a variable go outside of the meaningful range.
* For expression containing more than one operator,are the assumptions about the order of evaluation and precedence of operators correct.
* Are there any invalid uses of integer arithmetic, particularily division.

### 比较错误(Comparison Errors)

* Are there any comparison between variables having different data types.
* Are there any mixed-mode comparisons or comparisons between variables of different lengths.
* Are the comparison operators correct.
* Does each Boolean expression state what it is supposed to state.
* Are the operands of a Boolean operator Boolean.Have comparison and Boolean operators been erroneously mixed together.
* Are there any comparisons between fractional or floating-point numbers that are represented in base-2 by the underlying machine.
* For expressions contain more than one Boolean operator, are the assumptions about the order of evaluation and the precedence of operators correct.
* Does the way in which the compiler evaluates Boolean expressions affect the program. 

### 控制流错误(Control-Flow Errors)

* If the program contains a multipath branch such as a computed GOTO,can the index variable ever exceed the number of branch posibilities.
* Will every loop eventually terminate.
* Will the program,module,or subroutine eventually terminate.
* Is it possible that,because of the conditions upon entry,a loop will never excute?If so,does this represent an oversight.
* For a loop controlled by both iteration and a Boolean condition(e.g.,a search loop) what are the consequences of the loop fall-through.
* Are there any off-by-one errors, such as one too many or too few iterations? This is a common error in zero-based loops. You will often forget to count 0 as a number.
* If the language contains a concept of statement groups or code blocks(e.g., do while or {...}), is there an explicity while for each group? and do the instances of do correspond to their appropriate groups? Is there a closing bracket for each open bracket? Most common compilers will complain of such mismatches.
* Are there any nonexhuanstive decisions.

### 接口错误(Interface Errors)

* Does the number of parameters received by this module equal the number of arguments sent by each of the calling modules? Also, is the order correct.
* Do the attributes(e.g.,data type and size) of each parameter match the attributes of each corresponing argument.
* Does the units system of each parameter match the units system of each corresponding argument.
* Does the number of arguments passed by this module to another module equal the number of parameter expected by that module.
* Do the attributes of each argument passed to another module match the attributes of the corresponding parameter in that module.
* Does the units system of each argument passed to another module match the units system of corresponding parameter in that module.
* If build-in functions are invoked, are the number, attributes, and order of the arguments correct.
* If a module or class has multiple entry points, is a parameter ever referenced that is not associated with the current entry point.
* Does a subroutine alter a parameter that is intended to be only an input value.
* If global variables are present, do they have the same definition and attributes in all modules that reference them.
* Are constants ever passed as arguments.

### 输入/输出错误(Input/Output Errors)

* If files are explicitly declared, are there attributes correct.
* Are the attributes of the file's OPEN statement correct.
* Does the format specification agree with the information in the I/O statement.
* Is sufficient memory avlilable to hold the file your program will read.
* Have all files been opened before use.
* Have all files been closed after use.
* Are end-of-file conditions detected and handled correctly.
* Are I/O error conditions handled correctly.
* Are the spelling or grammatical errors in any text that is printed or displayed by the program.
* Does the program properly handle "File Not Found" errors.

### 其它检查(Other Checks)

* If the compiler produces a cross-reference listing of identifiers, examine it for variables that never are referenced or are referenced only once.
* If the compoler produces a attribute listing, check the attributes of each variable ensure that no unexpected default attributes have been assigned.
* If the program compiled successfully, but computer produces one or more "warning" or "informational" messages, check each one carefully. Warning messages are indications that the compiler suspects you are doing something questionable validity: Review all of these suspicions. Informational messages may list undeclared variables or language use that impede code optimization.
* Is the program or module sufficiently robust? That is, does it check its input for validity.
* Is a function missing from the program.
